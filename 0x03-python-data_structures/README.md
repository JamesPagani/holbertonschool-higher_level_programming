# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project covers the usage of Lists and Tuples, which are Python's equivalent of arrays in other programming languages (like C). Unlike arrays, these data structures can store elements of different data types (though it is still recommended to fill them with one type).

Both Lists and Tuples store elements. The main difference between both is that Lists can be edited while Tuples cannot.
