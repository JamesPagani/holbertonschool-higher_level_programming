# Holberton Higher Level Programming

As part of the second trimester of Holberton Coding School, we're going to program in a "higher level" programming language. In this case, its going to be Python.

Named after the british comedy group *Monty Python*, Python is a High-Level and general purpose interpreted programming language developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is well known for being easy to read, easy to understand and its great expandability. It can also expand to C (the language) and related, should the Python program require a more "low level" access.

What differentiates Python from more traditional languages is that its code does not require compiling in order to work thanks to its interpreter, meaning that testing code can be done much faster than the code/test/compile/re-compile approach.
