# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

This is a continuation of project 0x06 of Python (Classes an Objects). Unlike that project, this one handles the destructor method (__del__), the "informal" and "formal" string representations of objects (__str__ and __repr__ respectively), class methods and static methods.
