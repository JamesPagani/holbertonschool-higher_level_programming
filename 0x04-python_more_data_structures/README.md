This project covers the usage these Python data structures:
- Lists
- Tuples
- Set
- Dictionary

The first two were seen on the previous project (0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples). This project focuses on learning the usage of the last two (Sets and Dictionaries), along with the functions Lambda, filter, reduce and map.
