# 0x14. Javascript - Web scraping

This project is similar to the web scraping done in Python (Holberton System Engineering - 0x15. API and 0x16. API advanced). The main difference is that we will be doing this using a NPM library called request, which is used to make HTTP requests using JavaScript. We will also briefly manipulate files using Node.js built-in File System (fs) module.
